# Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open a public issue. Report it privately so we can triage and fix it without exposing sensitive details.

Preferred contact methods:

- Open a private issue by selecting the "Security" contact option on this repository, or
- Contact the repository owner on GitHub: `https://github.com/Yabets-art`.
- (Optional) Email: `yabetsd29@gmail.com` — replace this with a monitored security contact address.

When reporting, include:
- A concise description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Affected versions and environment details
- Any suggested mitigations or patches

We will respond as soon as possible and coordinate disclosure and fixes.
